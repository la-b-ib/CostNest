  Got an idea for a new feature or improvement? Let us know by creating an issue. Please provide a detailed description of your suggestion and explain how it would benefit users.

- **Submitting Pull Requests:**  
  We encourage you to fork the repository, make your changes on a feature branch, and submit a pull request (PR). Please ensure your PR is well-scoped, includes clear commit messages, and addresses an existing issue (if applicable).  
  Before starting on a major feature, it’s a good idea to open an issue for discussion.

## Code Style & Guidelines

  Please keep your code consistent with the existing codebase. Use meaningful variable names, and include comments where necessary. If you add any new libraries or dependencies, mention them in the documentation.

- **Documentation:**  
  Ensure that any new features or changes are well-documented. Update the README or add additional documentation if needed.
