Thank you for your interest in contributing to CostNest! We welcome contributions that help improve the project, whether it's through bug fixes, new features, documentation enhancements, or performance optimizations.

## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can help make CostNest better:

- **Reporting Bugs:**  
  If you encounter any issues or bugs, please [open an issue](https://github.com/la-b-ib/CostNest/issues) with detailed information—including steps to reproduce the problem, your Chrome version, and any error messages.

- **Suggesting Enhancements:**  
  Got an idea for a new feature or improvement? Let us know by creating an issue. Please provide a detailed description of your suggestion and explain how it would benefit users.

- **Submitting Pull Requests:**  
  We encourage you to fork the repository, make your changes on a feature branch, and submit a pull request (PR). Please ensure your PR is well-scoped, includes clear commit messages, and addresses an existing issue (if applicable).  
  Before starting on a major feature, it’s a good idea to open an issue for discussion.

## Setting Up Your Local Environment

1. **Fork the Repository:**  
   Visit [https://github.com/la-b-ib/CostNest](https://github.com/la-b-ib/CostNest) and click the **Fork** button.

2. **Clone Your Fork:**  
   Clone your fork locally:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CostNest.git
   cd CostNest
   ```

3. **Create a Feature Branch:**  
   Always create a new branch for your changes:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Make Your Changes:**  
   Develop your feature or bug fix. Be sure to follow modern JavaScript (ES6+) practices and keep your code clean and well-commented.

5. **Commit and Push:**  
   Write clear commit messages and push your branch to your fork:  
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: short description of your changes"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request:**  
   Once your changes are ready, open a pull request from your feature branch to the `main` branch in the original repository. Include a clear description of your work and reference any related issues.

## Code Style & Guidelines

- **JavaScript, HTML, & CSS:**  
  Please keep your code consistent with the existing codebase. Use meaningful variable names, and include comments where necessary. If you add any new libraries or dependencies, mention them in the documentation.

- **Documentation:**  
  Ensure that any new features or changes are well-documented. Update the README or add additional documentation if needed.

- **Testing:**  
  Test your changes locally to make sure nothing is broken. If applicable, provide steps for testers to verify your changes.

## Issue Coordination

- **Before Reporting:**  
  Search through existing issues to avoid duplicates.

- **When Reporting:**  
  Provide as much detail as possible. For bug reports, include steps to reproduce, error messages, and your system environment.
