# CostNest — Advanced Expense Tracker Chrome Extension

CostNest is a feature-rich Chrome extension designed to track and analyze your online shopping expenses. Incorporating secure PIN-lock access with auto-lock after inactivity, it empowers you to add, edit, sort, and filter expenses with ease. Interactive data visualizations (pie charts and line charts) provide insights into spending by category and monthly trends. The extension also supports data backup/restore, CSV export, and a monthly budgeting feature via an intuitive Material Design user interface.
